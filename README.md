# Circular-Buffer
Arduino/C++ library in a single header for utilizing a smart circular buffer.

A circular buffer is a data structure where the ends of the buffer are connected.
### Properties of Circular Buffers
* When the buffer is full it overwrites the oldest data
* When elements are removed or retrieved the oldest values are affected.

## Compiler
* This library was built and compiled with the [ARM GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/downloads) 
## Installation
* Clone the library into the libraries directory. No additional dependencies are required (some boards may need the standard smart pointer library)
